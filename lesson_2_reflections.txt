1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A repository is necessary to store the commits made when using git. The repository doesn't exist until git is commanded to create one.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I didn't really understand what is the staging area. I think it seems to help highlight the elements of a repository that play a role in the commit I am about to create. It just keeps things more organised.
